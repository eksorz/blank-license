# New License Introduction

## About

The new licensing system is a content that works with its own API key and the help of GitHub. It is a very useful system for storing, storing or licensing your files. More detailed usage has been shared as open source for the development phase. You can contact us if you experience any problems or create problems.

## Auxiliary API and Links

**From GitHub:** Create a new repository, install a modules.json file in it, take the Raw link and paste it correctly into the arguments of the constructor function.

**From Self-API:** Currently unavailable.

## Functions in Classes

*This system was prepared as Object-Oriented Programming in commit.*

```lua
ObjectClass = {}
ObjectClass.__index = ObjectClass;

--[[
    Functions:
        ObjectClass.new (constructor)
        ObjectClass:implement (application)

    Classes:
        ObjectClass;
]]
